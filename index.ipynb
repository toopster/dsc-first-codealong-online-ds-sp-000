Our goal here is just to give you a taste of what you'll be able to do as a Data Scientist, and afterwards, we'll go back and re-introduce all of the concepts that we skimmed over this time through. By the end of the section, you should have a much stronger understanding of this process - even if you have no previous programming experience.\n",

This can alternatively be replaced with double quotes `df[\"col_name\"]`. In general, anything in quotations is a string in Python code. Occasionally, with very ill formatted column names with quotations in the names themselves, you may even need to wrap a name in triple quotes `df[\"\"\"col_name\"\"\"]` . This will rarely happen in this particular context, but it's the general pattern for dealing with messy strings.   \n",

Similar to tab completion with the command line, this is a primary reason why programmers use dashes (-) and underscores (_) in lieu of whitespace in their variable and file names. Also note that no quotations are used when using this format. (The column names have been stored as attributes of the DataFrame object!)"
